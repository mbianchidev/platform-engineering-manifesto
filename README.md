# Manifesto for Platform Engineering

We are uncovering better ways of creating 
platform and improving the Developer Experience by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools (Kubernetes doesn't solve it all)

** Working incremental modules** over comprehensive all-in-one out of the box pipelines

**Listening to developer feedback** over business driven requirements

**Tailoring the platform to the needs** over enforcing standars top down

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
